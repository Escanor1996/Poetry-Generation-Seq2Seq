# Poetry-Generation-Seq2Seq


This repository contains the code to generate poetry using Seq2Seq model architecture.

This Seq2Seq model is trained on the robert frost poetries. After training it succesfully generates poetry. Soem examples are there in the jupyter notebook.

The implementation is in keras.

I have used pretrained word embeddings from http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip for better performance.
